# Cas12a-CViT：A Deep Learning Model for Cas12a Targeting Efficiency Predicting
## Introduction
This repository hosts a novel classification model designed to predict the targeting efficiency of Cas12a (formerly Cpf1) guide RNAs. Accurately predicting on-target efficacy is crucial for maximizing the success of CRISPR-Cas12a based genome editing experiments. Our model leverages machine learning techniques to identify gRNAs that are likely to be highly effective, thereby saving time and resources in experimental workflows.
