Column Descriptions:
Dataset_HT_1_1 is the train data and Dataset_HT_1_2 is the test data
for raw_data:
  
50 bp synthetic target and target context sequence（10 bp + PAM + 23 bp protospacer + 17 bp）：A 50-base synthetic DNA sequence that includes both the CRISPR target site and surrounding context. Composed of 10 bases upstream of the protospacer, the PAM (Protospacer Adjacent Motif), the 23 bp protospacer sequence itself, and 17 downstream bases. 

34 bp synthetic target and target context sequence（4 bp + PAM + 23 bp protospacer + 3 bp）：This column is the sequence we use for training.A shortened 34-base synthetic sequence containing 4 bp upstream, the PAM, the 23 bp protospacer, and 3 bp downstream. 

20 bp guide sequence (5' to 3'):The 20-base guide RNA sequence used to direct the Cpf1 enzyme to the DNA target, listed in the 5' to 3' direction.

Indel frequency (%, Background):Percentage of insertion or deletion mutations (indels) observed in the background group, without Cpf1 delivery. Reflects baseline noise or off-target activity.

Indel read count (Background):Total number of sequencing reads in the background group, used to calculate the indel frequency.

Indel frequency (Cpf1 delivered, %):Percentage of indels observed after Cpf1 delivery. Represents the genome editing efficiency of the CRISPR system.

Indel read count (Cpf1 delivered):Number of reads containing indels after Cpf1 has been delivered.

Total read count (Cpf1 delivered):Total number of reads in the Cpf1-delivered group.

Indel frequency (Background subtracted, %):Indel frequency with background subtracted, indicating the net effect of Cpf1 activity.

methylation_status:Methylation status for each base in the sequence. 'N' indicates unmethylated data,and "A" indicates methylated. Methylation can affect CRISPR binding and cleavage efficiency.

dnase_signal_status:DNase signal status per base.'A' for accessible and 'N' for not accessible. Reflects chromatin accessibility, potentially impacting CRISPR cleavage.

label:Label for classification: 0 indicates low editing activity, 1 indicates high activity. And the label data comes from the Indel frequency (Background subtracted, %),if the indel frequency>50,we mark it as 1(high activity),otherwise it will be 0(low editing activity)
  
for processed_data:
  
  We use the 34 bp synthetic target and target context sequence as the main feature,and we add the methylation_status and dnase_signal_status as another two features.The label column is the label data

  The enhance data is generated by applying randomization to the last two positions of the original sequences, resulting in a dataset that is 16 times larger than the original.
